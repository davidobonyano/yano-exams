# Results Visibility Protection

## üîí **Protected Show/Hide Results Functionality**

The RLS policy fixes have been carefully designed to preserve your show/hide results functionality. Here's how it works:

## ‚úÖ **What's Protected**

### **1. Teacher Control Preserved** 
- Teachers can still toggle `show_results_after_submit` in AdminDashboard
- Toggle switch updates database field normally  
- Creating sessions with result visibility settings works unchanged

### **2. Student Access Controlled**
- Students can **ONLY** see results when `show_results_after_submit = true`
- When `show_results_after_submit = false`, students get the blocked results page
- RLS policies respect this setting at the database level

### **3. Post-Submission Logic Intact**
- After exam submission, the redirect logic still works:
  - `show_results_after_submit = true` ‚Üí `/results/{attemptId}`  
  - `show_results_after_submit = false` ‚Üí `/dashboard?examSubmitted=true`

## üõ°Ô∏è **RLS Policy Implementation**

### **exam_results Table**
```sql
-- Students can ONLY view results if show_results_after_submit is enabled
CREATE POLICY "Allow exam results operations with visibility control" 
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR  -- Teachers see all
  (auth.uid() IS NULL AND attempt_id IN (
    SELECT sea.id FROM student_exam_attempts sea
    JOIN exam_sessions es ON sea.session_id = es.id
    WHERE es.show_results_after_submit = true  -- KEY CONTROL
    AND es.status IN ('active', 'ended')
  )) OR
  auth.role() = 'service_role'
);
```

### **exam_sessions Table**
```sql
-- Students can read session data (including show_results_after_submit field)
-- but result visibility is controlled by exam_results policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow exam sessions access for students" 
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR
  (auth.uid() IS NULL AND status IN ('active', 'ended') 
   AND starts_at <= NOW() AND ends_at >= (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'))
);
```

## üîÑ **How It Works Together**

1. **During Exam Submission**: Student completes exam
2. **Redirect Logic**: `SessionExamInterface.tsx` checks `show_results_after_submit`
3. **If Results Enabled**: Student goes to `/results/{attemptId}`
4. **Database Query**: `SessionExamResults.tsx` queries exam_results table
5. **RLS Check**: Policy allows/denies based on `show_results_after_submit` setting
6. **Student Experience**: 
   - ‚úÖ **Enabled**: See full results page with score, answers, etc.
   - üö´ **Disabled**: See "Results Under Review" blocked page

## üéØ **Key Features Maintained**

- **Immediate Control**: Teachers can toggle results visibility anytime
- **Secure**: Students cannot bypass the setting even with direct API calls
- **Consistent**: Same behavior across all result viewing components
- **Graceful**: Students see professional blocked page when results are hidden
- **Flexible**: Works with both session-based and regular exam interfaces

## ‚ö° **No Breaking Changes**

Your existing show/hide results functionality will work exactly as before. The RLS policies add security without changing the user experience or teacher controls.
