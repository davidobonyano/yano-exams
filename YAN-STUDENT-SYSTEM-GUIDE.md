# 🎓 YAN School Student Management System

## 🎯 Overview
A simple, clean student management system with **YAN/number** format IDs that's perfect for real school integration.

## 📊 Student ID Format
**Format**: `YAN001`, `YAN002`, `YAN003`, etc.

**Features**:
- ✅ **Unique across all classes** - No two students can have the same number
- ✅ **Sequential numbering** - Based on creation order
- ✅ **Simple and clean** - Easy to integrate with school websites
- ✅ **No class confusion** - Works for any class level

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `database/simple-school-student-system.sql`
4. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Test the System
1. Go to your admin dashboard
2. Click **"Manage Students"**
3. Try adding a new student
4. You should see IDs like `YAN001`, `YAN002`, etc.

## 📋 How It Works

### Student Creation Order
- **First student created** → `YAN001`
- **Second student created** → `YAN002`
- **Third student created** → `YAN003`
- And so on...

### Example Scenarios
```
Teacher creates students in this order:
1. Alice (JSS1) → YAN001
2. Bob (SS1) → YAN002  
3. Carol (JSS2) → YAN003
4. David (SS3) → YAN004
```

**Result**: Each student gets a unique number regardless of class!
