# Session-Based Exam Platform Testing Guide

## üéØ System Overview

The platform now uses a **Session-Based Authentication System** instead of email/password:

- **Students**: Join with Session Code + Student ID + Name + Class
- **Teachers**: Use email/password for admin access
- **Sessions**: Time-controlled exam access with unique codes

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Set up Supabase Database

```bash
# 1. Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com

# 5. Update .env.local with your Supabase credentials
```
